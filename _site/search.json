Blogging I have been tinkering with these computer things for a long time and have avoided this whole thing.\nNow that blogging is passe, I figure it is a good time to start.\n\n\nWhy Now?\nWell, I have been using R and Python for a long time and playing with Dash and Shiny and JS but have never really structured my approach. I was at the Posit conference this year and decided to get a bit more into some of the front end things that I enjoy playing with and a blog might be a way to keep it on track.\n\n\nHow are you doing this????\nI know, pretty magical right? In reality I am using Quarto’s blog platform/git/AWS s3 buckets. Well not yet, I am writing this one in a text editor locally with the intention of putting it on the big scary internet. If you are reading this, i have probably suceeded … but I am sure I will post about that if I keep this going."

I switched the site into the root of the bucket. but I forgot to render the whole quarto\nand again. having trouble getting s3 and route 53 to play nice\nand again but i reformatted my lists at least\nbut we keep deploying to fix s3 issues\nand again"
