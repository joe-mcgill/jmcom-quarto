### Did this work

github actions are weird at first glance. maybe this all worked

### It did not

I think the error was in the github actions side not the s3 side.

I guess I might as well start a list since this will require multiple testing commits
- Here is the first nonsense commit
- Try two. I switched the site into the root of the bucket. but I forgot to render the whole quarto
- and again. having trouble getting s3 and route 53 to play nice
